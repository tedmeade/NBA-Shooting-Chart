# NBA-Shooting-Chart
This project displays the shooting charts of 4 different NBA players during the 2021 Playoffs of last year.
This isn't an interative project, but more so a display of how live broadcast or sports websites may show certain statistics of different athletes.
I first imported data from NBA.com giving me individual player statistics based on the coordinates of their shot and whether they made or missed it. 
I then used ggplot to graph their shots and diversify whether they made it or not based on different colors.
I also imported a court image to make the shooting chart more accurate and user friendly so that you may see where on the court each player shot from.
The overall image is split into a grid so that I could place the shooting chart, title, and player image in their appropreiate places with almost identical formats.
Once the grid is complete with the proper data I saved it as a complete image to replicate what you may see on a sports website. I hope you enjoy!
